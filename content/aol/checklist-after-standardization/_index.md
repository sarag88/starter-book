**Checklist AFTER creating the standardized syllabi:**

1. **Academic committee should approve** the standard syllabus for any given course in their department  
2. **Department should ensure** all course sections in upcoming academic semesters use the approved standardized syllabus. 
3. **Academic committee must share with CMU** any updated or newly approved standardized syllabus as it is important for AoL planning purposes. 
    * Only updates to **course description, learning goals, or mapping table** are of interest to the CMU. Other sections in the syllabus can be updated and revised without notifying the CMU and can also differ from section to section. 
4. **Academic department should maintain a centralized repository** of all standardized syllabi for easy access by faculty members, we recommend using teams to store these files. 
5. **Assign member of the department Academic Committee** who should update, maintain, and send a reminder before the start of every semester reminding faculty members (especially new faculty members) to get a copy of the approved standardized syllabus template for their course and use it to construct their course syllabus. 
6. **Faculty members should always use a copy of the approved standardized syllabus** to construct a new syllabus and ensure any approved changes to course content by the academic committee would be reflected in the new syllabus.
