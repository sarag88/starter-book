**Assessment Guidelines**

**303 Business Communications** was selected to perform assessment of Communication skills (Written and Oral). Please remember that the goal is to assess how effective the **undergraduate program curriculum** was in developing these skills in our students. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that the CMU receive an assessment that reflects the true skills of our students. 

Because there are multiple sections of the course, there needs to be some level of coordination between faculty to ensure that the assessments across sections are comparable. To that end, we seek the cooperation of the faculty members to designate one oral presentation and one written report from the requirements to be used for the assessment  

**For the oral presentation:**
1. Can be individual or group based. For group presentations all group members should participate in the presentation so they can be assessed. 
2. There is no need to unify the topic of the presentation, just the AoL assessment performed for the CMU (i.e., using the rubric to assess student performance). 

**For the written report:**
1. Must be individual based
2. Students should be required to submit a professionally typed report utilizing APA or ML style formatting. 
3. There is no need to unify the topic of the report, however, we highly recommend that **faculty coordinate across sections** to ensure that the reports submitted by the students are somewhat comparable.  

**For both the oral presentation and written report:** 
1. Students DO NOT need to know that an AoL assessment is being performed. To them the presentation or report is part of their coursework.
2. Faculty members can grade the oral presentation or written report in any way they see fit. They also have the options to use the rubric to calculate student score for their course assignment or project (recommended to reduce duplication of effort in assessing students, you can adapt the rubric by adding additional items to meet your class requirements). 
3. The AoL assessment required by the CMU can be independent of the class grading scheme and must use the attached [Oral](oral.docx) and Written Communications Rubrics to assess student presentations and reports by filling the corresponding excel sheet with student scores and ids **then sending it to cmu@cba.edu.kw.**
4. We highly recommend introducing the students to the Oral and Written Communications rubrics so they could get a sense of what a good presentation or report would entail. 
5. AoL assessment can be performed by Faculty or TAs during the presentation or after grading the presentation but should never be performed by students. 
   
**Recommendations to Improve Assessment Results**
CMU offers the following recommendations and would encourage faculty agree on a common set of guidelines, thatare not limited to the following:
* Setting a maximum or minimum word limit for the reports 
* Setting a time limit for presentations or number of slides 
* Specifying the required sections in the report or presentation or agreeing on a unified template
