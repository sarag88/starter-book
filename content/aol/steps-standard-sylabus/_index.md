**Steps to Standardizing a Syllabus**

Please note that this is a department wide effort that should be guided and approved by the departmental academic committee. The CMU recommends that a faculty member currently teaching the course would ensure that the syllabus is standardized for their course and perform the steps included in this list. 

**The standardization should be performed only once in our lifetime.** After completion, if standardized syllabi are properly maintained and used by everyone in the department, no further standardization effort is needed in subsequent semesters as faculty would reuse the same syllabi that are maintained by the department. 

**To create a standardized syllabus, please follow these steps:**
1. Use the latest attached standardized syllabus template attached with this packet to construct a standardized syllabus for each course.  
2. Update the course description and ensure it matches the course description approved by KU.  
    * Copy of official course descriptions for all CBA courses attached with this package. 
    * If recent efforts to update course descriptions and content were approved by KU are not reflected in the official course descriptions document, kindly communicate the update to CMU. 
    * Faculty members can optionally add additional paragraphs to further clarify the course description. 
3. Check that course learning objectives (CLOs) exist for the course and add them if missing: 
    * Information on drafting learning objectives [below](/drafting-clos)
     * Course learning objectives (CLOs) are necessary for AoL planning and should be maintained and updated by the academic department.  
4. Perform the mapping of the course learning objectives (CLOs) to CBA’s competency goals. This is a necessary step to show how well the curriculum fits with CBA’s strategy and is necessary for AoL planning. To perform the mapping, please follow these steps: 
    * Compare each CLO (by their number) to CBA’s competency goals found at the end of the standardized syllabus template or attached with this packet. Specifically, you need to compare them to the competency goal’s student learning objectives as they reflect the operational definitions. 
    * If the goals match, then this means that the course explicitly addresses the competency skill as defined by the competency’s learning objectives. The link must be made in the mapping table in the syllabus by putting one of the following letters in the appropriate cell to reflect the type of coverage (or emphases) in the course: 
        * **I** for **Introduce**: Students will be introduced to the skill and their grasp of it assessed in the course.  
        * **A** for **Apply**: The course will not cover the skill. Students should have a high-level grasp of the skill and are required to apply it in the course.  
        * **R** for **Reinforce**: Students should have an introductory-level grasp of the skill and the course will improve their mastery to a higher level. 
    * Once mapping table is completed, compare the course mapping to the curriculum map to ensure that it is correct for the course 
        * If a single competency goal has multiple types of emphases, then **precedence is given to R then A then I.** 
        * **It is very important to communicate any updates to the curriculum map to the CMU**
